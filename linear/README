The initial configuration for the dsDNA model without phosphates can be found here. This is the one of a linear dsDNA, 1000 bp long, with its axis pointing along the positive z-direction (starting from z=0).
In this file:

    1.-Each nucleotide is represented by a rigid body with two interaction sites, so in total there are 4000 particles (2000 per single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)).
    2.-The first 2000 particles correspond to the patchy beads in the first strand:
	a)Odd indices represent the "bead" sites.
	b)Even indices represent the "patch" sites.
    3.-Since a nucleotide is made by two particles, there are 1000 rigid bodies per ssDNA.
       For example, particles 1 and 2 are part of the same molecule: 1.
    4.-The type of particles in the first strand:
	a)All the patches are of type 2.
	b)Every interactive bead (type 1) is followed by two ghost beads (type 5).
    5.-The complementary ssDNA (last 2000 particles) are arrange in a similar way to the first ssDNA:
	a)Odd indices represent the "bead" sites.
	b)Even indices represent the "patch" sites.
	c)All the patches are of type 4.
	d)Every interactive bead (type 3) is followed by two ghost beads (type 6).

The type of interactions are explained in detail in our soft matter paper. These are summarized here:
    1.-Backbone: set by fene bonds(type 1) between consecutive beads in the same strand. This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, ..., 1997-1999
                 Strand 2: 2001-2003, 2003-2005, 2005-2007, ..., 3997-3999
    2.-Hydrogen Bonds: set by a harmonic/shift/cut bond(type 2) between complementary patches. This means between indices:
                 2-2002, 4-2004, 6-2006, ..., 2000-4000.
    3.-Stacking interaction: set by a morse potential that is implemented in lammps by a bond (type 3) between consecutive
       patches in the same strand. This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, ..., 1998-2000.
                 Strand 2: 2002-2004, 2004-2006, 2006-2008, ..., 3998-4000.

    4.-Roll interaction: set by a harmonic angle (type 1) between two consecutive patches and the bead of the second patch.
       This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 2-4-3, 4-6-5, 6-8-7, ..., 1998-2000-1999.
                 Strand 2: 2002-2004-2003, 2004-2006-2005, 2006-2008-2007, ..., 3998-4000-3999.
       We include also a constraint in the first bases (just for the linear chain) of each strand with the same type of angle.
                 Strand 1: 1-2-4.
                 Strand 2: 2001-2002-2004.
    5.-Kratkyâ€“Porod potential: set by a cosine angle (type 2) between three sonsecutive patches in the same strand.
       This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 2-4-6, 4-6-8, 6-8-10, ..., 1996-1998-2000.
                 Strand 2: 2002-2004-2006, 2004-2006-2008, 2006-2008-2010, ..., 3996-3998-4000.

    6.-Dihedral for the right-handedness of the chain.(type 1) between the quadrupled of monomers (bead-patch-patch-bead).
       This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 1-2-4-3, 3-4-6-5, 5-6-8-7, ...,1997-1998-2000-1999.
                 Strand 2: 2001-2002-2004-2003, 2003-2004-2006-2005, 2005-2006-2008-2007, ...,3997-3998-4000-3999.

In order to run the LAMMPS script type in a terminal:

     ./lmp_serial_22Aug2018 -in commands_lammps_dsDNA

Please note that since the simulation starts from an artificial configuration that is far from equilibrium (a straight line), at the beggining will appear some warnings (FENE bond too long). The warnings will appear less often once the radius of gyration decreases to a constant value. In addition, we leave some room for the fene bond to change from the average value 0.465 to the maximum value R0=0.6825 set in the lammps script (this is slightly larger than the variations that the real backbone could have) the warnings appear because the bond is getting close to this value, and the user shouldn't worry about them (the simulation will not crash).
