Note: We recommend the user to first familiarise with the dsDNA model without phosphates and then to continue with the dsDNA model with phosphates.

The initial configuration for the model with phosphates is the one of a linear dsDNA, 1000 bp long, with its axis pointing along the positive z-direction (starting from z=0).
In this file:

    1.-Each nucleotide is represented by a rigid body with three interaction sites, so in total there are 6000 particles (3000 per single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)).
    2.-The first 3000 particles correspond to the patchy beads in the first strand:
	a)The "bead" sites are represented by indices:      1, 4, 7, ..., 2998.
	b)The "patch" sites are represented by indices:     2, 5, 8, ..., 2999.
	c)The "phosphate" sites are represented by indices: 3, 6, 9, ..., 3000.
    3.-Since a nucleotide is made by three particles, there are 1000 rigid bodies per ssDNA.
       For example, particles 1, 2 and 3 are part of the same molecule: 1.
    4.-The type of particles in the first strand:
	a)All the patches are of type 2.
	b)Every interactive bead (type 1) is followed by two ghost beads (type 5).
        c)All the phosphates are type 7.
    5.-The complementary ssDNA (last 3000 particles) are arrange in a similar way to the first ssDNA:
	a)The "bead" sites are represented by indices:      3001, 3004, 3007, ..., 5998.
	b)The "patch" sites are represented by indices:     3002, 3005, 3008, ..., 5999.
	c)The "phosphate" sites are represented by indices: 3003, 3006, 3009, ..., 6000.
	d)All the patches are of type 4.
	e)Every interactive bead (type 3) is followed by two ghost beads (type 6).
        f)All the phosphates are type 8.

The type of interactions are explained in detail in our paper. These are summarized here:
    1.-Backbone: set by fene bonds(type 1) between consecutive beads in the same strand. This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 1-4, 4-7, 7-10, ..., 2995-2998.
                 Strand 2: 3001-3004, 3004-3007, 3007-3010, ..., 5995-5998
    2.-Hydrogen Bonds: set by a harmonic/shift/cut bond(type 2) between complementary patches. This means between indices:
                 2-3002, 5-3005, 8-3008, ..., 2999-5999.
    3.-Stacking interaction: set by a morse potential that is implemented in lammps by a bond (type 3) between consecutive
       patches in the same strand. This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 2-5, 5-8, 8-11, ..., 2996-2999.
                 Strand 2: 3002-3005, 3005-3008, 3008-3011, ..., 5996-5999.

    4.-Roll interaction: set by a harmonic angle (type 1) between two consecutive patches and the bead of the second patch.
       This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 2-5-4, 5-8-7, 8-11-10, ..., 2996-2999-2998.
                 Strand 2: 3002-3005-3004, 3005-3008-3007, 3008-3011-3010, ..., 5996-5999-5998.
       We include also a constraint in the first bases (just for the linear chain) of each strand with the same type of angle.
                 Strand 1: 1-2-5.
                 Strand 2: 3001-3002-3005.
    5.-Kratkyâ€“Porod potential: set by a cosine angle (type 2) between three sonsecutive patches in the same strand.
       This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 2-5-8, 5-8-11, 8-11-14, ..., 2993-2996-2999.
                 Strand 2: 3002-3005-3008, 3005-3008-3011, 3008-3011-3014, ..., 5993-5996-5999.

    6.-Dihedral for the right-handedness of the chain.(type 1) between the quadrupled of monomers (bead-patch-patch-bead).
       This means between indices:
                 Strand 1: 1-2-5-4, 4-5-8-7, 7-8-11-10, ...,2995-2996-2999-2998.
                 Strand 2: 3001-3002-3005-3004, 3004-3005-3008-3007, 3007-3008-3011-3010, ...,5995-5996-5999-5998.
